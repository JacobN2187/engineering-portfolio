Custom Fidgets

Fidgets offer tactile stimulus to occupy restless energy that can disrupt concentration. Frustrated by noisy, distracing mainstream options, I design quiet, tactilely satisfying fidgets to subtly enhance focus. I originally designed “the perfect fidget” for myself, but when my peers asked to buy it from me, I knew I had to make something for them. Inspired by their feedback, I use CAD tools and 3D printing to refine my tactile and mechanical actions to create a compelling user experience. In fact, When placed in public settings, my creations rarely sit idle for long; people instinctively reach for them, effortlessly channeling distraction into calm productivity
Selected designs:


Fidget Cube


Six different combinations of textures and dynamic tactile experiences.
Magnetic slider, embedded ball bearings, gears, wheel, and joystick.
All in a 1 ¼ inch cube.




Diamond Spinner
2 identical magnetic sides that rotate about a pin. Satisfying in its simplicity. Comes in variety of colors.

Prosthetic Card-holding Hand


As a class project, I prototyped a card-holding prosthetic for a below-elbow amputee. Features include:
* Sweat wicking adjustable attachment points 
* Scrabble-like holder with a capacity of 25 playing cards (6 if sides do not overlap)
* Customizable front design
* The card-holding portion can be detached easily to stand on a flat surface.

Millennium Falcon


I taught myself how to use Blender and Fusion 360 by modeling the
Millennium Falcon from Star Wars from reference photos.  Using my
university’s 3D printer to print the ship inspired me to get my own
printer.


I am currently modeling the ship in Solidworks.

0.005” Tolerance Hammer 
During a manufacturing class at Case Western, I learned the fundamentals of
metal machining enabling me to make a hammer with 0.005” tolerances. 
The tools I used to make this steel hammer include:
* Bandsaw
* Lathe
* Mill
   * Reamer
* Drill press
   * Counterbore
   * Countersink
* Benchtop Grinder and Polishing Wheel
* Threaded Tap Wrench
* CNC mill

Carpet Sweeper


As part of a group project, I designed a broom with a belt-driven brush, to work as an unpowered vacuum cleaner. The design complied with Case’s engineering documentation standards. It was manufacturable with the tools available in a standard machine shop, and had a cost of materials in line with the purpose it served.
