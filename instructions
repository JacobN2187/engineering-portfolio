instructions
Make me a beautiful website for my engineering porfolio.
Use only material in ingredients folder
Do not change anything in ingredients
Do not do anything with with the DO_NOT_USE folder
Use dark mode
The content should be one page with text adn images beautifully laid out.
Have a selector menu on the left side of the screen that scrolls to the proper spot. 
Make sure it works correctly on mobile, tablet and desktop.
Make it as beautiful as possible.
I want this to be a static website that I will host later.
Make sure GIFs loop endlessly.
Ignore the CSWA certificate
Give the website a captivating engineering theme but keep it professional and simple.
